This is a reproduction of an issue with tailwind v4.0.0-alpha.28.

Prior to this version (0.21 - 0.27), the tailwindcss-animate plugin was working well.
However, with the new version, the plugin is not working as expected.

As you can see in the main page.tsx, the `animate-in fade-in zoom-in` classes are not working as expected.

THE CURRENT VERSION OF TAILWINDCSS IS 4.0.0-alpha.28
